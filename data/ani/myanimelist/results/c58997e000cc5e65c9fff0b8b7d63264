        "synopsis": "In 2022, the world of virtual reality was upended by the arrival of a new invention from a genius programmer, Akihiko Kayaba, called NerveGear. It was the first full-dive system, and with it, came endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its successor, the Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn&#039;t have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is &quot;Ordinal Scale&quot; (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAsuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, by the time Kirito decides to join them. They&#039;re about to find out that Ordinal Scale isn&#039;t all fun and games...<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: Aniplex USA)",
